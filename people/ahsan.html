  <p id="bio">My name is Ahsan Azim!<br><br>I'm "from" Lahore, Pakistan, although
    my dad's job has meant that I've lived variously in New York, the Netherlands,
    and (kind of) Italy.<br><br> Currently, I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth
    College, in Hanover, New Hampshire. I'm studying Computer Science, Math,
    and Government. I really enjoy each of those subjects, and plan for a
    career that somehow mixes at least two of them <br><br>
    If you want to get specific, then my academic interests are as follows:</p>
  <ul id="academic_interests_list">
    <li><em>Computer Science</em> : Machine Learning, Data Analysis, NLP,
      iOS App Development</li>
    <li><em>Mathematics</em> : Statistics, Linear Algebra, Pure Mathematics</li>
    <li><em>Government</em> : Comparative Politics</li>
  </ul>
