      <p style = "font-family:Helvetica; font-size:18px">My name is Matthew Goldstein. I'm a
        sophomore at Dartmouth College, majoring in Philosophy and Computer
        Science, but I spend most of my time drawing cartoons that my parents
        and some of my friends find funny. I enjoy when the first and last
        words of a novel form a coherent phrase. My dislikes include social
        climbing, green olives, TV commercials for awnings, genocide, and
        zippers that get stuck frequently. I have worked at MSNBC, with a
        health juice company, for a hedge fund, and in a beach club food court.
        Contrary to popular belief, I have only ten toes. I once took a
        philosophy class in which I began to question my own existence, but
        then I got a paper cut and I realized I was, unfortunately, still
        there. I have never had a P.O. box.
